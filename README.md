# AstroHawk
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a low cost DIY astro-station with builtin guider.

# Why inbuilt guider?
The commercial guide cameras available today almost always use USB interface to connect to a telescope mount or a mount PC. This adds to the cable management complexity and occupies a USB port on the mount PC. What if the guide camera did not use USB cable? Better still what if the guide camera itself could control the telescope system? Wouldnâ€™t that be cool?!

On top on this, the Raspberry Pi cameras chosen for this project fare very well when compared with commercial offerings.
